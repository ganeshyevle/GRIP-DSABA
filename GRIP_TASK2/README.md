## TASK 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
The Sparks Foundation

AUTHOR: GANESH KAILAS YEVLE<br>

BATCH: GRIPJULY2022<br>

For this task we will use the 'Iris' dataset and predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
(Predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.)

Conclusion: We are able to predict the optimum number of clusteri.e.3 and also visualize them with the help of scatter plot.
